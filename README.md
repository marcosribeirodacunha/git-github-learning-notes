# Welcome to the Git and GitHub learning notes

This repo contains a variety on notes about how to interact with Git and GitHub, some handy commands and some explanations about some concepts.
Some of the information written here are my notes from the Google's [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) course on the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform.
